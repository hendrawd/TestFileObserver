# TestFileObserver
Test project to test file observer

I created this project to test if Exif modification that trigger FileObserver.CREATE

After the project created, there is a problem that file observer not working

FileObserver failed now with the new android studio 2.2.2 when create a new project

Amazingly, my old project that used FileObserver still working fine right now
